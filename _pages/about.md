I am a senior undergraduate student from School of Physics, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ze-Liang Xiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=akB8u4sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Prof. Xueyue Zhang](https://xueyue-sherry-zhang.github.io/), and [Prof. Gyu Boong Jo](https://ultracold.ust.hk/group/pi-gyu-boong-jo-ph-d).

My experiences range from theoretical explorations of quantum systems in waveguides to leadership roles in national physics competitions and academic societies. With a strong foundation in both the theoretical and experimental aspects of physics and a keen ability to lead and collaborate, I am driven to further explore the quantum realm. 

My ambition is to contribute to groundbreaking advancements in quantum technology and exploring quantum phenomena.


Research Interest
======

My research interest focuses on waveguide QED, particularly the long-range and many-body interactions it induces. I am dedicated to investigating their physical applications in quantum networks and quantum state transfer, exploring the phenomena of many-body entanglement and quantum simulation. These studies are pivotal for advancing our understanding of quantum systems and have profound implications for the development of quantum technologies.

In addition to my primary focus on waveguide quantum electrodynamics and its implications for quantum networks and quantum computing, I hold a keen interest in a broader spectrum of quantum phenomena. My explorations extend into quantum computing, quantum phase transitions, and quantum chaos. These areas represent the cutting edge of quantum science and offer profound insights into the fundamental workings of the universe. As I deepen my understanding, I aim to integrate these interests to address overarching questions in quantum technology and theoretical physics, contributing to the advancement of quantum science.
