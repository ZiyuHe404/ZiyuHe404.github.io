excerpt: "In a dual-rail waveguide, we have theoretically designed a three-level giant atom configuration and calculated its scattering properties for  incident photons. Such a configuration enables quantum routing of incident photons, quantum gate circuits, quantum RAM, quantum circulator, and quantum teleportation, all of which can be realized by tuning the coupling parameters and phases. These advances contribute to the development of quantum networks.

In a dual-rail waveguide, we have theoretically designed a three-level giant atom configuration and calculated its scattering properties for incident photons. Such a configuration enables quantum routing of incident photons, quantum gate circuits, quantum RAM, quantum circulator, and quantum teleportation, all of which can be realized by tuning the coupling parameters and phases. These advances contribute to the development of quantum networks.

The following diagram illustrates the scattering properties as a tunable quantum circulator.

We have also calculated the non-Markovian effects of this giant atom configuration in the waveguide and its impact on scattering behavior.
