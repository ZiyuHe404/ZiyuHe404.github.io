Driven by a passion for physics, I aim to explore exotic phenomena. My experiences range from the theoretical calculation of scattering matrix within a dual-rail waveguide to the experimental exploration of two-dimensional ultracold atoms. With a strong foundation in both theoretical and experimental physics, and a keen ability to communicate and collaborate, I am eager to delve deeper into the this exciting area.

**Entanglement Stability and Autonomous Error Correction in Driven-Dissipative Systems**

Driven-dissipative systems offer rich opportunities to study entanglement and its resilience in the presence of noise. My research focuses on understanding the stability of entanglement in such systems. A key aspect of this work is the exploration of autonomous error correction strategies, where driven-dissipative systems actively correct errors without the need for classical feedback mechanisms. Additionally, I investigate the newly proposed Average Symmetry-Protected Topological (ASPT) phases, which provide a novel perspective on the topological classification of open systems. 

**Novel Optics Phenomena in Waveguide Systems**

In optics, the light-matter interaction has long been a foundation for understanding phenomena, particularly in cavity. Waveguide extends this concept by coupling atoms to one-dimensional electromagnetic modes, leading to long-range interactions and collective effects. In this context, I study a variety of novel phenomena, such as photon-photon interactions and the emergence of many-body phenomena in waveguide systems. 

**Many-Body Phenomena in Ultracold Atomic Systems**

My interest also extends to the study of many-body phenomena in ultracold atomic systems, where the controlled environment allows for the observation of phase transitions and novel dynamics. A central focus is the Bose-Hubbard model, which captures the behavior of interacting bosons on a lattice, and its implications for phase transitions, such as superfluid-to-Mott insulator transitions. By exploring the dynamics of these systems, I aim to uncover deeper insights into correlations, critical phenomena, and collective behaviors that are relevant for both fundamental physics and future technologies.
