I am a third year undergraduate student from School of Physics, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ze-Liang Xiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=akB8u4sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

My experiences range from theoretical explorations of quantum systems in waveguides to leadership roles in national physics competitions and academic societies. With a strong foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of physics and a keen ability to lead and collaborate, I am driven to further explore the quantum realm. 

My ambition is to contribute to groundbreaking advancements in quantum technology and exploring quantum phenomena.
