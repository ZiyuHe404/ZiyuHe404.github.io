title: "Analytical and Numerical Study of Photons in Nonlinear Waveguide"
excerpt: "We started to investigate in nonlinear waveguide which is composed of nonlinear coupled cavity array. Inspired by the previous work, we reproduce their calculations of two photons bound state. Further, we aimed to utilize this nonlinear interaction to generate driven-disspasive cat state and further explored entangled cat state.

In this project, we reproduced the [work](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.213601) in nonlinear waveguide. Given the discrete translational symmetry, the state in two photon subspace can be represented as $$e^{i K r_c} \psi_{K}(r^{\prime}) $$ using Bloch theorem. Here, $$K$$ is the total wavevector, $$r_c$$ and $$r^{\prime}$$ represents the center of mass position and the relative displacement. We calculated the eigenstate and eigenenergy of this system, identifying a two photon bound state. The figure below shows the relative wavefunction $$\psi_{K}(r^{\prime})$$ and the eigenenergy at certain $$K$$.

Another significant result is the Wigner function of a flying Schr√∂dinger cat state, generated by modulating the coupling strength between a driven nonlinear cavity and a waveguide. This demonstrates the creation of a traveling cat state via a classically driven Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillator. Our findings align closely with the original study.
