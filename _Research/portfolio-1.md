title: "Tunable Quantum Router in a Dual-Rail Quantum Network via Giant Atom"
excerpt: "In a dual-rail waveguide, we have theoretically designed a three level giant atom and calculated its scattering properties for incident photons. This configuration enables high-fidelity quantum routing, quantum gates, and quantum circulators, all of which can be realized by tuning the coupling parameters. These advances contribute to the development of quantum networks.

In a dual-rail waveguide, we have theoretically designed a $$\nabla$$-type giant atom and calculated its scattering properties for incident photons. This configuration enables high-fidelity quantum routing, quantum gates, and quantum circulators, all of which can be realized by tuning the coupling parameters. These advances contribute to the development of quantum networks.

Here, we shows scatering probabilities of the giant atom.

The following diagram illustrates the scattering properties as a tunable quantum circulator.

We have also calculated the non-Markovian effects of this giant atom configuration in the waveguide and its impact on scattering behavior.
