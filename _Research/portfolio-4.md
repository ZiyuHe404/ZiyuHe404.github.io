title: "Fitting the ToF of the 2D Yb Ultracold Atom"
excerpt: "We utilized the numerical approach proposed by Alexander Holm Kiilerich and Klaus Mølmer to study the interactions between incident light in various quantum states and localized quantum systems within a waveguide. We aimed to generate specific, highly non-classical quantum states of light by designing configurations for localized quantum systems. Additionally, we focused on encoding information into distinct temporal modes, further advancing quantum communication technologies' capabilities.
