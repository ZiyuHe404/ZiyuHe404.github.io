title: "Numerical Study of Quantum Pulse Interaction with Localized Quantum Systems"
excerpt: "We utilized the approach proposed by Alexander Holm Kiilerich and Klaus Mølmer to study the interactions between incident light in various quantum states and localized quantum systems within a waveguide. We aimed to generate specific, highly non-classical quantum states of light by designing configurations for localized quantum systems. Additionally, we focused on encoding information into distinct temporal modes, further advancing quantum communication technologies' capabilities.

We utilized the [approach](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.123604) proposed by Alexander Holm Kiilerich and Klaus Mølmer to study the interactions between incident light in various quantum states and localized quantum systems within a waveguide. We aimed to generate specific, highly non-classical quantum states of light by designing configurations for localized quantum systems. Additionally, we focused on encoding information into distinct temporal modes, further advancing quantum communication technologies' capabilities.

The following image shows the Wigner function of a flying cat state, which is generated by modulating the coupling strength between a driven nonlinear caviy and a waveguide.
