# Quantum Entanglement

## Introduction
Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum physics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently.

## Mathematical Description
The state of an entangled system can be written as:

$$|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_A|1\rangle_B - |1\rangle_A|0\rangle_B)$$

This is known as a Bell state, one of the simplest examples of quantum entanglement.

## Applications
1. Quantum Computing
2. Quantum Cryptography
3. Quantum Teleportation

## Recent Developments
- Experimental verification of quantum entanglement over long distances
- Applications in quantum networks
- Advances in quantum memory
