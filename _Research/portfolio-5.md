title: "Experimental Survey of Giant Atom in Superconducting Circuits"
excerpt: "In a giant atom project, we conducted experiments on a transmon qubit capacitive coupled at two distinct points to a coplanar waveguide. I calibrated the transmon frequency and analyzed its relationship with the Z line bias using dispersive readout techniques in this ongoing project.
