I am a senior undergraduate student at the School of Physics, [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ze-Liang Xiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=akB8u4sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Prof. Xueyue Zhang](https://xueyue-sherry-zhang.github.io/), and [Prof. Gyu Boong Jo](https://ultracold.ust.hk/group/pi-gyu-boong-jo-ph-d).

Driven by a passion for quantum physics, I aim to contribute to advancements in quantum technology and explore exotic quantum phenomena. My experiences range from the theoretical design of a quantum router within a dual-rail waveguide to the experimental exploration of two-dimensional ultracold atoms. With a strong foundation in both theoretical and experimental physics, and a keen ability to communicate and collaborate, I am eager to delve deeper into the quantum realm.

Research Interests
======

My research interests center on waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED), particularly focusing on the long-range and many-body interactions it induces. I am dedicated to investigating the physical applications of these interactions in quantum networks and quantum state transfer, exploring phenomena such as many-body entanglement and quantum simulation. I believe these studies are pivotal for advancing our understanding of quantum systems and have profound implications for the development of quantum technologies.

In addition to waveguide QED, my interests and experiences extend to quantum computing with superconducting qubits and phase transitions in ultracold atoms. I have participated in experimental research on superconducting circuits and ultracold atoms, which has broadened my perspective and deepened my appreciation for experimental approaches in quantum physics. These areas represent the forefront of quantum science and offer significant insights into the fundamental workings of the universe.

As I pursue my doctoral studies, I aim to integrate these diverse interests to address fundamental questions in quantum technology and theoretical physics. By combining theoretical and experimental approaches, I hope to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of quantum science and the development of novel quantum technologies.
