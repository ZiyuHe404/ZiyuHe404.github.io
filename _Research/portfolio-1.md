title: "Tunable Quantum Router in a Dual-Rail Quantum Network via Giant Atom"
excerpt: "We have theoretically designed a tunable quantum router using a three-level giant atom embedded in a dual-rail waveguide. By calculating the scattering properties for incident photons, we demonstrated that this configuration enables high-fidelity quantum routing, quantum gates, and quantum circulatorsâ€”all achievable by tuning the coupling parameters. These advances contribute significantly to the development of quantum networks.

In this project, we propose a tunable quantum router based on a $$\nabla$$-type giant atom embedded in a dual-rail waveguide, implemented on a superconducting circuits platform. By employing the Bethe ansatz method, we calculated the scattering properties of incident photons interacting with the giant atom.

Our results reveal **chiral and nonreciprocal** scattering behaviors, which can be harnessed to implement advanced quantum devices. The novel scattering properties are illustrated below:

These findings enable the realization of quantum routers, quantum gates, and quantum circulators through parameter tuning. The following diagram demonstrates the giant atom functioning as a tunable quantum circulator:

Additionally, we investigated the **non-Markovian** effects arising from the giant atom configuration within the waveguide and analyzed their impact on scattering behavior:
